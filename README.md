# EuRuKo 2017 Recommendations from Budapest natives

This is a list of places that we, Budapest-based Rubyists could personally recommend as our go-to spots in the city. If you are also a local and think you could add to the list, maybe consider a PR os that we can share our favourite places with the Ruby community.

NOTE: The aim of this list is to keep it local and mainly focus on places that may not be in the typical Budapest tour guides.

__Also, if you are opening a PR, please send me a notification tweet at @attilagyorffy so that I won't have to watch github all the time.__

My go-to spot to have a nice lunch with the taste of Hungarian dishes. Sausages, local grilled meat with different flavours. Paprika. Mmmm-mm paprika. And pickles. Pickles are great too.


## Jónás Craft Beer House

Nice atmosphere on the riverside, local craft beer and unique pálinka selction. The only place that has beetroot palinka. Great view overlooking the Danube, good beer and quite a few spots outside to sit.

If you are into the old Turkish style baths, this one has a jakuzzi outside with a view over the Danube. And a bar underneath.

Bar on the riverbank with beer and cocktails. Seats on the riverside with a view next to the Széchenyi Chain Bridge. Has DJs and sometimes concerts as well.

Lots of quality vedgies and fresh meat to chose from, sold by farmers. If you are into souvenirs, this may be your spot too.

Rooftop bar overlooking the city from above. Nice cocktails and some good beer around. This time of the year, you should probably get a jacket, it may be a tiny bit windy but the view is absolute fantastic.
